# tfc2als
A tool for converting a '.tfc' file into a '.als' Alloy program for solving the quantum teleportation minimization DQC problem.
## How to Use
To run see `python3 tfc2als.py --help`.
## Warning
This tool was created to generate '.als' files that could be manually edited and given back to the tool for execution.
For long term use, this tool needs to be recreated and expressed using the Alloy Java API without the '.als' file intermediate step.
